Pipeline Steps
==============

The AIND Ephys Pipeline consists of several key processing steps that are executed in sequence. Here's a detailed look at each step:

Job Dispatch
------------

The `job-dispatch <https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/aind-ephys-job-dispatch/>`_ step:

* Generates JSON files for parallel processing
* Enables parallelization across:
   * Multiple probes
   * Multiple shanks (e.g., for NP2-4shank probes)
* Creates independent processing jobs for parallel execution

Preprocessing
-------------

The `preprocessing <https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/aind-ephys-preprocessing/>`_ step handles several critical data preparation tasks:

* Phase shift correction
* Highpass filtering
* Denoising
   * Bad channel removal
   * Common median reference ("cmr") or highpass spatial filter ("destripe")
* Motion estimation and correction (optional)

Spike Sorting
-------------

The pipeline supports multiple spike sorting algorithms:

* `Kilosort2.5 <https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/aind-ephys-spikesort-kilosort25/>`_
* `Kilosort4 <https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/aind-ephys-spikesort-kilosort4/>`_
* `SpykingCircus2 <https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/aind-ephys-spikesort-spykingcircus2/>`_
* `Lupin <https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/aind-ephys-spikesort-lupin/>`_

Each sorter can be selected based on your specific needs and data characteristics.

Postprocessing
--------------

The `postprocessing <https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/aind-ephys-postprocessing/>`_ step performs additional processing on the 
combined preprocessed recording and sorted data:

* Removal of duplicate units
* Computations of *extensions*:

   * Waveforms extraction
   * Templates
   * Spike amplitudes
   * Amplitude scalings
   * Unit locations
   * Principal Component Analysis (PCA) projections
   * Spike locations
   * Correlograms
   * Template similarity
   * Template metrics
   * Quality metrics
   * Valid unit periods

Curation
--------

The `curation <https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/aind-ephys-curation/>`_ step applies quality control by:

* Quality metrics-based filtering using thresholds on:
   * ISI violation ratio
   * Presence ratio
   * Amplitude cutoff
* Unit classification as noise, MUA, or SUA using `UnitRefine <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.30.645770v1.full>`_ pretrained classifiers.
* Unit classification as good, mua, or noise using `Bombcell <https://zenodo.org/records/8172822>`_
* Automatic merging suggestions using `SLAy <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.06.20.660590v2>`_

The *recipe* for quality metrics can be customized to suit your specific needs.

Visualization
-------------

The `visualization <https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/aind-ephys-visualization/>`_ step generates static figures and interactive Figurl links for each probe:

* *timeseries*: including snippets of raw data, drift map, and motion visualizations
* *sorting_summary*: for spike sorting results inspection and curation

Each plot of the *timeseries* is also saved as a static image in the ``visualization/`` folder.

Result Collection
-----------------

The `result collection <https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/aind-ephys-results-collector/>`_ step:

* Aggregates outputs from all parallel jobs
* Copies output folders to the results directory
* Organizes results in a standardized structure

NWB Export
----------

The final step creates standardized NWB output files, including:

* Ecephys data from `aind-ecephys-nwb <https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/aind-ecephys-nwb>`_
* Unit data from `aind-units-nwb <https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/aind-units-nwb>`_

Features:

* Supports multiple streams (e.g., probes) per file
* Optional raw data and LFP data writing
